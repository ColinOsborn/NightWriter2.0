# Night Writer

A project that takes a normal plain text file and translates the file into Braille. In the past, soldiers used Braille as a way of communicating to each other silently at night by passing messages written in the Braille format.

This program will now replicate your own personal Braille translator so that you're never left out from the line of communication.
